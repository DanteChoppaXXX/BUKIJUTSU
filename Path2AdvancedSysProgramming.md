# 🪜 Project Progression for Systems/Network Programming

---

## **Step 1 — Strengthen Your Socket Server**

📌 *Goal:* Turn your first attempt into a solid, reusable base.

* Add `SO_REUSEADDR` so you can restart quickly.
* Fix `client_sockets[]` initialization and partial `write()` handling.
* Add a simple **broadcast feature**: when one client sends a message, the server relays it to all connected clients.

👉 **Result:** A working **multi-client chat server**.

---

## **Step 2 — Thread Pool Server**

📌 *Goal:* Move away from “1 thread per client.”

* Create a **fixed pool of worker threads**.
* Main thread: only `accept()` connections and put them in a queue.
* Worker threads: dequeue sockets and handle them.
* Use mutex + condition variable for the queue.

👉 **Result:** A **scalable server** that can handle hundreds of clients without spawning hundreds of threads.

---

## **Step 3 — Non-Blocking I/O**

📌 *Goal:* Learn multiplexing.

* Convert your server to **non-blocking sockets**.
* Use `select()` first (simpler), then `poll()`, then `epoll()` (Linux) for efficiency.
* Each client is handled in a single event loop, no threads needed.

👉 **Result:** A **single-threaded high-concurrency echo server** (like a baby Nginx).

---

## **Step 4 — Implement a Protocol**

📌 *Goal:* Move from “raw sockets” to **protocol handling**.

* Implement a subset of **HTTP 1.0**: support `GET /file.txt`.
* Serve static files from disk.
* Add error codes (`404 Not Found`, `400 Bad Request`).
* Log requests to a file.

👉 **Result:** A working **mini web server** you can connect to in a browser.

---

## **Step 5 — Reliability & Security**

📌 *Goal:* Make servers robust and safe.

* Add **timeouts** using `setsockopt(SO_RCVTIMEO)` or `epoll` timers.
* Handle malformed input safely (no buffer overflows).
* Drop privileges: run server as non-root, chroot jail.
* Learn to test with `curl`, `netcat`, and `ab` (ApacheBench).

👉 **Result:** A **hardened HTTP server** that can withstand basic abuse.

## **Step 6 — Advanced Systems Projects**

Pick one or more depending on your interests:

### 🔹 If you like **Networking**

* Build a **TLS-like encrypted chat protocol** using OpenSSL.
* Write a **basic proxy server** (accepts client connections, forwards traffic).

### 🔹 If you like **Databases / File Systems**

* Write a **key-value store** with persistence (append-only log, like Redis).
* Implement a **B-tree index** that lives on disk.

### 🔹 If you like **OS Internals**

* Write a **character device driver** in Linux (`/dev/mydevice`).
* Build a **strace-lite** using `ptrace()` to log syscalls.

---

## **Step 7 — Capstone**

📌 *Goal:* Put it all together.

* A **multi-threaded, epoll-based web server** with:

  * Config file (port, docroot, max clients).
  * Logging system (rotating logs).
  * Static file serving.
  * Graceful shutdown on signals.
* Bonus: support multiple worker processes (`fork()`), like Nginx’s master/worker model.

👉 **Result:** You’ll basically have built a **production-style server** from scratch.

---

## 🏆 By the end

* You’ll know threads, mutexes, condition variables.
* You’ll master non-blocking I/O (`epoll`, `select`).
* You’ll have implemented real protocols (HTTP, maybe TLS).
* You’ll understand process management, signals, and even kernel interfaces.

That’s exactly what pushes someone into **advanced systems programmer** territory.
