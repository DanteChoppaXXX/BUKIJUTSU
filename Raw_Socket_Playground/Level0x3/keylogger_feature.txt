** MULTI-CLIENT KEYLOGGER SERVER (CLIENTS SENDS KEYSTROKES) **

* Understand The Problem:=> I want a server that handles multiple clients connection and stores keystrokes sent by the the clients.

* Plan A Solution:=> The Server needs to do the follow:
    - Handle multiple clients connection Concurrently.
    - Store connected client's socket in an array.
    - Be able to identify each clients.
    - Receive and store keystrokes with the associated client.[e.g {Client_ID: "Client's Keystrokes"}].
    - Remove disconnected clients from the lists of connected clients.
    - Clean up resources and exit gracefully upon termination.

* Code The Solution:=> Let's Get Going!

* Reflect On The Solution:=>
